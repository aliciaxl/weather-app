# weather-app

This is a weather app that fetches data from an IP API, a geoloation API, and a weather API to display the current weather based on the user's location. It also has an animation of a boy and a bear, inspired by artist Lang's Hirono collection. The color theme of the app changes with daytime or nighttime.
